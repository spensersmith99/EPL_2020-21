# EPL_2020-21

This is a project I worked on in my spare time that combined two of my most favorite passions: data analytics and soccer. 
Here, we will be using data from the 2020-2021 Premier League season. 
I will be providing valuable insight into how goals/assists recorded are correlated to a team's placement in the league. 
Also, I will be adopting my own metric called OVR which will attempt to quantify a player's overall performance in the league. 
Furthermore, we will be looking at how expected goals scored vs actual goals scored to identify players who under or overperformed.
