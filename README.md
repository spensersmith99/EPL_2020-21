# EPL_2020-21

This is a project I worked on in my spare time that combined two of my most favorite passions: data analytics and soccer. 
Here, we will be using data from the 2020-2021 Premier League season. The only goal of this project was to apply what I have learned so far and to explore some particular interests I had in regards to the inner workings of soccer.
